We promote and support diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. We welcome people from all backgrounds to consider joining our lab, especially members of historically marginalized communities. 

Before applying for or inquiring about any of the opportunities listed below, **please thoroughly review the research projects and publications on this website to understand what we are doing.**

### Postdoctoral scholars
Currently there is no project-based postdoc position available. However, you can apply to the following fellowship programs at Columbia/TC and identify Dr. Yu as one of your faculty mentors. These programs support fully independent postdoc positions and are highly competitive.

- [DSI Postdoctoral Fellows Program](https://apply.interfolio.com/157225) (Deadline: December 15, 2024) 
- [TC Minority Postdoctoral Fellow](https://employment.tc.columbia.edu/cw/en-us/job/512981/minority-postdoctoral-fellow) (Deadline: December 31, 2024)

### Doctoral students
We admit **new doctoral students** through the following programs:

- [Cognitive Science in Education](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/cognitive-studies-in-education/degrees--requirements/cognitive-science-in-education-phd/) (Deadline: December 1, 2024) 
- [Measurement and Evaluation](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/measurement-evaluation-and-statistics/degrees--requirements/measurement-and-evaluation-phd/) (Deadline: December 1, 2024) 

You should apply to one (and only one) of the programs that best suits your background and interest, and mention that you want to work with Dr. Yu in your statement of purpose. You can find more application instructions [here](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/admission/how-to-apply/degree-programs/).

**Current doctoral students** at TC/Columbia are welcome to email Dr. Yu about potential collaboration.

### Visiting scholars
Researchers and doctoral students outside of Columbia are welcome to email Dr. Yu about the possibility of research visits, if there is secured financial support.

### Master's and undergraduate students
If you are a Columbia student (including Barnard and TC) and interested in getting involved in a research project, please fill out the [Research Interest Form](https://forms.gle/bFthcBY2LLwKvMFd9). When positions become available, we will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with our projects, and reach out to candidates for any additional materials and interviews.

You are also welcome to take a course taught by Dr. Yu to foster mutual understanding before you join the lab. The next course will be HUDK 4051 (Learning Analytics: Process and Theory), offered in Spring 2025.
