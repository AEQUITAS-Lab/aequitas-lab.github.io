We promote and support diversity, equity, and inclusion in academia. We welcome people from all backgrounds to consider joining our lab, especially members of historically marginalized communities.

### Postdoctoral scholars
Currently there is no project-based postdoc position available. However, you can apply to Columbia's [DSI Postdoctoral Fellows Program](https://apply.interfolio.com/157225) and identify Dr. Yu as one of your faculty collaborators. Applications are due on December 15 every year. 

### Doctoral students
We admit **new doctoral students** through the following programs:

- [Cognitive Science in Education](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/cognitive-studies-in-education/degrees--requirements/cognitive-science-in-education-phd/)
- [Measurement and Evaluation](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/measurement-evaluation-and-statistics/degrees--requirements/measurement-and-evaluation-phd/)

You should apply to one (and only one) of the programs that best suits your background and interest, and mention that you want to work with Dr. Yu in the statement of purpose. Applications are due on December 1 every year and you can find application instructions [here](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/admission/how-to-apply/degree-programs/).

**Current doctoral students** at TC/Columbia are welcome to email Dr. Yu about potential collaboration.

### Visiting scholars
Researchers and doctoral students outside of Columbia are welcome to email Dr. Yu about the possibility of research visits, if there is secured financial support.

### Master's and undergraduate students
If you are a Columbia student (including Barnard and TC) and interested in getting involved in a research project, please fill out the [Research Interest Form](https://forms.gle/bFthcBY2LLwKvMFd9). When positions become available, we will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with our projects, and reach out to candidates for any additional materials and interviews.

You are also welcome to take a course taught by Dr. Yu to foster mutual understanding before you join the lab. The next course will be HUDK 4051 (Learning Analytics: Process and Theory), offered in Spring 2025.
