We conduct methodological and empirical research in two directions:   

1. Leverage data science and AI as methodological tools to answer social science questions  
2. Examine benefits and harms of data science and AI for society

We actively work with **under-resourced educational institutions and marginalized populations** to help improve their conditions with data science and AI.

## Current Projects

{% capture text %}
#### Longitudinal modeling of educational inequality
We investigate modeling strategies that convert longitudinal, unstructured data (e.g., digital traces, curricular content) into a rigorous understanding of how educational inequality accumulates through day-to-day teaching and learning experience.

#### Fairness and privacy in transfer learning
We examine issues of algorithmic fairness and data privacy in transfer learning to democratize access to trustworthy educational models especially for under-resourced contexts.

#### Digital divides in the age of generative AI
We leverage new data sources and analytical tools to track emerging digital divides incurred by the rapid development of generative AI at different levels of the educational system.
